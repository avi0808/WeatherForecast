How to build and execute:

Cucumber needs to be set up on eclipse.

Once the project is cloned and imported to eclipse, 
it can be executed using the Runner.java file under src/TestRunner


The feature file name and the Step Definition name to be executed 
should be changed accordingly in the path mentioned in features and glue 
respectively of the Runner.java file


Given more time, I can automate more test cases.
